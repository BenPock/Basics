<h1>Video games</h1>
<p>Since I was about 6 years old I have been consistantly playing video games.I started with a xbox 360 and used that untill I eventually upgraded to a xbox one.Once I started getting older I used more and more of the money I had to buy video games.Video games have been a great pass time to me.Some of my favorite games include.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hollow Knight</li>
<li>Elden ring</li>
<li>Minecraft</li>
<li>God of War</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pets</h2>
<p>I love animals mostly dogs and cats though,I have a dog named maple she is a <strong>brat</strong>she likes annoying people as much as possible.I never wanted a dog in the first place i would've rather had a cat but my moms <em>allergic</em> if i had to list the pets i would want the most it would go.</p>
